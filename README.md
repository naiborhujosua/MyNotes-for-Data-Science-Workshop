Being a self-taught **data scientist** is quite challenging for me .There are many factors that we have to face in order to advance this field. That's why i would like to take notes for every online learning that i will take in many platform such as Coursera, Packt, Udacity and Datacamp. I hope i can reinforce my learning rate into the right skills that could be implemented in my new career as a Data Scientist. Today's workshop is taken from one of the workshop from Packt called [Applied Data Science Workshop](https://courses.packtpub.com/collections?page=3). I hope we can learn together in order to dive deep into this field. 

Before exploring the data, we have to prepare for the tools that we will be using to get the insights of our data. We will be installing python. The easiet way to install it by downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). After installing the tools we can install some libraries that will help us do the anlysis of our data. in this case, we will use *pip* as package manager which is included in Anaconda through these command
- pip install numpy
+ pip install -r requirement.txt

The exercises and activities will be excuted in Jupyter Notebooks. It is a python library that can be installed using pip install jupyter. Since it is include in our Anaconda, we do not need it. we can run jupyter notebook by running a command jupyter notebook through our terminal in MaC or command prompt in windows. 

## Download the Course in Github
- Clone [Applied Data Science Workshop](https://github.com/PacktWorkshops/The-Applied-Data-Science-Workshop)
+ cd The-Applied-Data-Science-Workshop in your terminal to access the data
- run jupyter notebook to access the data in this workshop

1. [Boston Housing Dataset Analysis](https://github.com/naiborhujosua/MyNotes-for-Data-Science-Workshop/blob/master/Boston%20Housing%20Dataset.ipynb) I have been  learning about exploratory analysis in a jupyter notebook environment. I used vizualization such as scatter plots, histograms, and violin plots to deepen my understanding of the data, I also performed simple predictive modelling to consider the data for modelling. you can download the notebook to see the process. As I continue to learn and understand more, I will update this workshop for deeper contents.
